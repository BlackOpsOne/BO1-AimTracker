# BO1-AimTracker
An aim value tracker for Black Ops, tells you exactly which direction to turn.

## Using the Tool
- Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/BlackOpsOne/BO1-AimTracker/releases/latest) section and download `BO1-AimTracker.exe` ([direct download](https://github.com/BlackOpsOne/BO1-AimTracker/releases/latest/download/BO1-AimTracker.exe)), then open it along side the game, it will work with both Steam and BGamer.

- The aim tracker will tell you when you need to start turning for your aim to not get affected, which typically is at about `200,000` or `-200,000` depending which direction you turned the most. However, its completely up to you when to start turning.

- You can set the aim value back to `0` by clicking the "Reset Aim Value" button.

## Why?
If the aim value goes past a certain amount, your aim will become locked and you will be unable to turn. This is to prevent that from happening.

I know Furret made one previously, however his only displays the value and not how to read it, which caused some newer players to get confused.
